  <p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Hosting</a> is an easy to use CDN that's great for hosting Angular PWAs.</p>

  <p>First you'll need to have a Google account and to create a Firebase app.</p>

  <img-2 [attr.width]="imgWidth" [attr.height]="imgHeight" src="/assets/images/hosting-new-ready.png" alt="Firebase project ready"></img-2>

  <img-2 [attr.width]="imgWidth" [attr.height]="imgHeight" src="/assets/images/hosting-dashboard.png" alt="Firebase project dashboard"></img-2>


  <p>You'll need to install the Firebase tools CLI. We'll install it locally as a dev dependancy.</p>

  <node-package name="firebase-tools"></node-package>

  <p>You can disregard of the output from install.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh"
              command="npm install firebase-tools --save-dev"
              code="...

+ firebase-tools@3.18.4
added 333 packages from 182 contributors in 21.542s"></code-block>

  <p>If you are not familiar with <c-b code="npx"></c-b>, it runs the passed in command via the version of the package installed with <c-b code="package.json"></c-b> instead of the globally installed version.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" command="npx firebase --version" code="3.18.4"></code-block>

  <p>Once you have the Firebase CLI installed, you'll need to login.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" command="npx firebase login"></code-block>

  <p>Now from within the <c-b code="awesome-sauce"></c-b> project directory, we'll set up a new Firebase project.</p>

  <p>Select <c-b code="Hosting"></c-b> and any other Firebase services you plan to use.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh"
              command="npx firebase init"
              code="You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/abraham/dev/sandbox/awesome-sauce

? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. (Press <space> to s
elect)
 ◯ Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules
 ◯ Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore
 ◯ Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions
❯◉ Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites
 ◯ Storage: Deploy Cloud Storage security rules"></code-block>

  <p>The next option will be to select the Firebase project you created earlier.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" code="=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Select a default Firebase project for this directory:
Slides Today (slides-today)
Daily Cat (daily-cat)
❯ awesome-sauce-demo (awesome-sauce-demo)
Material Rocks (material-rocks)
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)"></code-block>

  <p>Followed by telling Firebase where your built code will live. Set it to <c-b code="dist/awesome-sauce"></c-b></p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" code="=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? (public)"></code-block>

  <p>Angular is a single-page app where multiple pages are served from the same <c-b code="index.html"></c-b> so confirm <c-b code="yes"></c-b>.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" code="? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? (y/N)"></code-block>

  <p>Firebase may try to be helpful and confirm overwritting <c-b code="index.html"></c-b>. The <c-b code="index.html"></c-b> in <c-b code="dist/awesome-sauce"></c-b> will get automatically overwritten at build time so your answer doesn't matter.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" code="? File dist/awesome-sauce/index.html already exists. Overwrite? (y/N)"></code-block>

  <p>Your local project folder has now been associated with a Firebase project. 🔥</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" code="i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

✔  Firebase initialization complete!"></code-block>

  <p>Let's see what's new.</p>


  <code-block lang="bsh"
              command="git status"
              code='On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   package.json

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .firebaserc
        firebase.json

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")'></code-block>

  <p><c-b code="package.json"></c-b> is different because we added <c-b code="firebase-tools"></c-b>.</p>

  <p>The first new file is a bit of config tells the Firebase CLI what project it's associated with. You should add this to <c-b code=".gitignore"></c-b></p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" command='echo ".firebaserc" >> .gitignore'></code-block>

  <p>The other new file is Firebase's general configuration. Currently it tells Hosting how to behave.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh"
              command='cat firebase.json'
              code='{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist/awesome-sauce",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}'></code-block>

  <mat-list role="list">
    <mat-list-item role="listitem">
      <c-b matLine code="public"></c-b>
      <p matLine>tells Firebase what directory to service files from.</p>

      <p matLine>tells Firebase how to map HTTP paths to files.</p>
    </mat-list-item>
  </mat-list>

  <p>Firebase projects can be deployed with <c-b code="firebase deploy"></c-b>, however we know Angular needs to be built first so let's combine that into a single command.</p>

  <p>Update <c-b code="package.json"></c-b> so that the <c-b code="scripts"></c-b> value looks like this.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" code='{
  "ng": "ng",
  "start": "ng serve",
  "build": "ng build",
  "deploy": "ng build --prod && firebase deploy",
  "test": "ng test",
  "lint": "ng lint",
  "e2e": "ng e2e"
}'></code-block>

  <p>This is another good place to commit changes.</p>

  <code-block lang="bsh" command='git add .'></code-block>

  <code-block lang="bsh"
            command="git commit -m 'Add Firebas Hosting config'"
